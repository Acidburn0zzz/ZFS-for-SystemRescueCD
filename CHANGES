testing modules with
    
CFLAGS="-O2 -march=nocona -mtune=generic -pipe"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
    
spl- & zfs-tree states are from upstream, NOW (11/20/2014; 20.11.2014)
    
Since lots of patches from the last testing modules have been merged meanwhile into upstream
and since 2129 (the major ARC changes) and the spl patch don't apply cleanly anymore - due to further evaluation work
they're left out for now;
as requested another round of test modules - now also for 3.10.45 kernel
    
additional SPL-patches:
* NONE this time
    
additional ZFS-patches:
* 10.10.2014_Illumos-4950 files sometimes can't be removed from a full filesystem_2784
* 14.11.2014_Illumos_5244 zio pipeline callers should explicitly invoke next stage_2828
* 14.11.2014_Store common Linux xattrs as native SA with xattr-sa_2809
* 19.11.2014_Don't read space maps during import for readonly pools_2909
    
This should make the modules especially helpful during troubleshooting and if you're affected by
one of the bugs in those additional patches
    
Keep in mind though that without the ARC changes there might be higher chance of possible OOM issues
(if your workflow causes it or has caused it in the past)
    
Cheers !
